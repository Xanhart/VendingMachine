HEY Josh and/or Craig

Hope your day is going well.

There are text files that are imparetive to run the program. 
I'm not sure if they will be put in the right folder "bin/debug".

The text files that need to move are:

logo.txt
mainmenu.txt.
purchasemenu.txt
feedmemoney.txt
inventory.txt

Thanks,
Go easy on her.
